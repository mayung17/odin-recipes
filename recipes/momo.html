<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
    Momo are bite-size dumplings made with a spoonful of stuffing wrapped in dough with origins from Tibet.
    Momo are usually steamed, though they are sometimes fried or steam-fried. Meat or vegetables fillings becomes succulent as it produces an intensively flavored broth sealed inside the wrappers. Variants first developed in Tibet, after it became popular among Asians.
    Eating dumplings on the first day of the new year was a widely spread custom in northern China. Written records show that dumplings became popular during the Southern and Northern dynasties (420–589 AD), the earliest unearthed real dumplings were found in Astana Cemetery dated between 499 AD and 640 AD.
